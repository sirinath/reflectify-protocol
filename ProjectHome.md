# Motivation #
Ability to use high performance type safe reflection library that can execute on any java platform including mobile (android). While most of the available solution use byte-code generation, this one comes with either runtime code generation or static code generation. The latter approach gives more flexibility and control over byte-code manipulation which may not be available on all platforms.

# Advantages #

  * Easy to use
  * Efficient with no performance penalty
  * Type safe
  * Platform independent
  * Maven integration
